# Rubik's cube color classification with Raspberry Pi using MobileNetV2

*This is my school project and also my first project to train a deep learning model. As a beginner, I just want to share how I trained the model for those who need, so this is not something like a tutorial. I am not sure whether my method is good but it works well with this kind of problem. So if you get stuck, give it a try.*

## Introduction
  My goal is to train many models, each one can detect a color on a Rubik's cube. Then with the prediction results, I just give it to the rubik_solver model (the link is [here](https://pypi.org/project/rubik-solver/))
